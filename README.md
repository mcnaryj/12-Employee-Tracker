## Demonstration


A demonstration of the app can be found at the following url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66R85GNfabY
The user is able to choose between which of the options they would like to view and roles and all that good stuff.

## Notes

There were elements that were relatively straightforward on this one, including the inquirer prompts, and building the data. Actually getting the "view all employees/roles/etc." was quite difficult, and it is not quite complete for the "View All Employees" prompt. Oh well.
